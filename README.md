# WeatherDashboard

## Description

This website displays a site where a user can search for a city and see the weather forecast for the current day, as well as, the next 5 days. It will also save each searched city to local storage and create a button for that city for a quick re-search for that city's weather.

## URL Link

## Usage

This site is meant to practice retrieving and displaying data from an API (OpenWeatherAPI). We are also utilizing JS library DayJS to retrieve the date/time and local storage to keep track of our cities.
